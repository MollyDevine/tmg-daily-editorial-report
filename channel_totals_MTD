---THIS QUERY READS FROM THE DAILY SITEWIDE TOTALS TABLE TO GIVE A SUM OF METRICS MONTH TO DATE FOR CURRENT MONTH AND MONTH TO DATE LAST MONTH. THIS IS USED TO CREATE MTD V LM COMPARISON IN DATA STUDIO. BECAUSE THIS IS DEPENDENT ON THE DAILY SITEWIDE TOTALS TABLE, THIS SHOULD BE RUN AFTER THE DAILY SITEWIDE TOTALS TABLE HAS BEEN RUN 

-- THIS QUERY SHOULD OVERWRITE tmg-reporting-dev:Daily_Editorial_Report.Sitewide_Totals_MTD DAILY
